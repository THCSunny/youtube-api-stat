# youtube-api-stat
This project we need to use the YouTube API key to obtain the data from YouTube. In this demonstration, I use a Taiwanese YouTube Channel called "攝圖日記" to do the data analysing. You can also analyse other YouTube channel that you like.
As the YouTuber may upload a new video to the channel, it may affect the statistics for the worse performing videos results.
