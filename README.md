# youtube-api-stat
In this project, we need to use the YouTube API key to obtain the data from YouTube. In this demonstration, a Taiwanese YouTube Channel called "攝圖日記" is used to do the data analysis. You can also analyse other YouTube channels that you like.  
As the YouTuber may upload a new video to the channel, it may affect the statistics for the worse-performing video results.
